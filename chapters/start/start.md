Hi. I'm shädam and this is my coding tutorial for those who asked. If you didn't, this might not be for you. I won't even introduce myself, because those who know, know.

This is going to be a lot of text so you might as well relax a bit and try to find a more suitable environment for reading it. The default github theme might not do a lot for you. I recommend downloading this repository and opening it in Visual Studio Code. Once you open the folder in vscode, right click on this file and click "Open Preview".

To continue, you will need to meet some prerequisites. I'm not writing this tutorial for clueless people. While it will start from basics, that's coding basics, not basics of how to use a computer or similar. If you can do the task I've given a moment ago in reasonable amount of time without too much confusion, that's a good sign.

The tutorial will be split across many files and stages. I plan on teaching bottom-up, that is starting at assembly and ending at high level languages, so that your understanding of what's going on is clear at all time.

Learning coding is like learning anything else. You will need to spend time and put in effort to actually do it. It will be tedious at times. You might need breaks. It does not take weeks, it takes years. You need to be patient and gradually step up the game. This, like any other tutorial, will only explain things and plant a seed in your head as to how something works. It's like a lecture at a university. Your job starts after reading all this. The real work. The practice, trial and error, messing around. Nobody can do that for you but you yourself. And if you actually do it, it will benefit you.

If after a couple chapters you find to not enjoy any of this, just drop it. If you don't enjoy it, you will have difficulties learning anything. Don't force yourself. Or just give yourself more time, who knows.
