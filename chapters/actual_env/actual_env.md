Now that you are a master at using the Linux terminal, we can begin rolling with the actual code. If you haven't trained the knowledge of the previous chapters yet, please do. Heck, even give yourself a good night's sleep to digest all of it. If you go too fast, you might not remember anything by tomorrow.

Let's start things off by setting some file system structure. Do `mkdir code; cd code`. Please create a new directory inside of `code` for every new chapter if you need to write any code. That will make things easier for both of us.

Next, call `code .`. That should open vscode in the freshly created folder. You can create new folders and files manually in terminal or via the vscode GUI, that's up to you, and I couldn't care less. It's not like I fancy creating a lot of files with terminal, if I'm already in vscode I might as well do it from there.

If you haven't yet done any practice, go back immediately. You must train the things here on your own. This is only passing you the starting knowledge, it's your job to develop it.
