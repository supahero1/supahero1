Now that you are a master at using the Linux terminal, we can begin rolling with the actual code. If you haven't trained yet the knowledge of the previous chapters, please do. Heck, even give yourself a good night's sleep to digest all of it. If you go too fast, you might not remember anything by tomorrow.

Let's start things off by setting some file system structure. Do `mkdir code; cd code`. Please create a new directory inside of `code` for every new chapter if you need to write any code. That will make things easier for both of us.

Next, call `code .`. A dot symbolizes the current location. Two dots on the other hand symbolize the folder above the current location, so if you wanted to move up to the parent directory, you would do `cd ..`.

The above should open vscode in the freshly created folder. You can create new folders and files manually in terminal or via the vscode GUI, that's up to you, and I couldn't care less. It's not like I fancy creating a lot of files with terminal, if I'm already in vscode I might as well do it from there.
