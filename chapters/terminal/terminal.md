Once you get Ubuntu working one way or the other, find the terminal and open it. Experiment with it. You can type in it but it's kind of funny, isn't it. It's all monospace and it shouts at you if you don't do the things it expects. Try typing `help` in it (and press enter afterwards to submit). Try `date`. Try `top`. That command displays all processes, with the most active ones being at the top. To quit it, press the letter `q` once (for Quit). Now try `watch -n 1 date`. That command will display you the result of the `date` command every second. You can't quit it with `q` now - you have to press `CTRL + C` to "interrupt" the program. Try `touch test.txt`. That will create an empty file called `test.txt` in the current working directory.

Essentially, terminal (or commandline) allows you to directly communicate with the filesystem, the kernel, all programs. It allows you to do everything, but via text, no graphical interface. But when working remotely, with a server thousands of miles away from you, this is the only option. The faster you get accustomed to it, the better. Once you become an expert at it, you will find it to be faster than using GUI, since that takes lengthy navigation and mouse movements.

Terminal accepts text as input and it gives text as output. The output may be your usual output or an error output that kind of has priority and is shown to you as soon as possible once it's generated. You don't need to know the details of that for now.

You will find documentation really helpful from here on out, to lead you. As shown before, programs wildly differ from each other. Some of them accept arguments (data to know what to do), but how to pass it? What do they spit out in return? How to stop their execution?

Answers to these and more questions can be found in the [manual pages](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/man-pages.7.html), man pages or man for short. It's also a command in the terminal. Try typing `man` in it. It will call you stupid for not specifying what you want to hear about, so specify that via `man man` to read about the manual pages themselves. This time around, unlike other commands I've listed above, somehow you're able to scroll in the terminal. Quit the program by pressing `q` whenever you feel like it.

In the Synopsis section, you can see roughly what arguments the program expects. Note here that when talking about terminal, most commands are really just programs, executables. So when in synopsis you see `man [section]`, it means that after the program name (in this case `man`) it expects some kind of `section` to follow. It's an optional argument, because of the square brackets. And that is actually written in the documentation for `man` itself, when you scroll down a bit. So, it would be ideal if you took your time now or a bit later to get accustomed to it. You don't need to memorize or even read all the options it has, because there's a lot of them and I've never used a single one of them. But just know that they are here, so that if you ever do need to use them, here's where you find them. As long as you know where to find the information you need, you don't need to explicitly remember it.

Additionally to `man`, you can often find some minimalistic documentation for a program when you add `-h` or `--help` as an argument. So for instance - `man --help` will send you a message about how to use that program, but this time around you can see it doesn't really dive deeper into anything in particular.

Note that most of the time program arguments are space separated. The only dillema is when an argument itself can accept a value. For instance, take the `watch` command that I've shown you before. It has an argument `-n` that denotes the time in seconds to refresh the view with the command specified afterwards. So, you need to specify the number of seconds, but you can do that in at least 2 ways - one is to do `-n 1`, second is to do `-n=1`, and there's probably more ways you can think of. Well, in the case of `watch` it doesn't recognize `-n=1`, but I know programs that prefer that over the first form.

A command in terminal must contain itself in a single line. You can't just press enter, since that will submit the command instead of inserting a newline. Terminal will wrap text for you, but if you think that's not good enough, you can actually use newlines, as long as you escape them first with a backslash, so you first press a backslash and then you press enter. You can then see terminal waiting for more input.

Try `code`. Surprise surprise, it *SHOULD* open vscode. If it doesn't, you haven't actually installed it properly.
