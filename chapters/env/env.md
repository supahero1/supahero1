`env` stands for `environment`. In coding, environment is basically everything around you at the time of coding. It's the same normal meaning of the word, but applied slightly abstractly.

Environment is a broad word. It can mean the operating system, the editor (a program that you use to write code), even pieces of code from other people that you can use called libraries or packages. Often it means all of those. Usually in bug reports to serious software, for instance if a program crashed unexpectedly, they will ask you to write down environment details, so that they can try to reproduce it themselves, by setting up the same environment.

For the needs of this tutorial, you will need Ubuntu one way or the other. It's not only because I'm lazy and don't want to provide any instructions for Windows since I'm using Ubuntu on a daily basis, even now, but also because Ubuntu runs on Linux.

Linux is an operating system. Windows is too, however Windows also provides much more, like applications, windowing system, well basically everything to let you use it easily. Linux is not that. It's much more barebone. It's only what sits behind the curtains on Windows.

Professionally, it's called a kernel. I could go on a long rant about how they work and much more, but maybe later, in a different chapter. For now, all you have to know is that working with Linux when it comes to coding is much easier than working with Windows, for starters. There's too many packages and libraries to even list. One could say that Windows has the attention of the gaming industry while Linux has the attention of the coding industry. It obviously depends on what you really want to do in the future once you mature as a programmer, but more commonly than not, knowing Linux is a skill you must have.

If you're on Windows right now, you could invest in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It's basically Ubuntu virtualized on Windows. You could also get a virtual machine and get Ubuntu on it. Both solutions work fine, since they both give you a graphical interface to work with. While there's other options for getting Linux working on Windows, they aren't as beginner-friendly as these two.

You could also install Ubuntu on a separate disk partition and run it alongside Windows. When you boot your computer, it will ask you about what system you want to get into. It's called dualboot, and it's the solution I'm currently going along with. I spend most of my time on Ubuntu, and if there's something I can't do from it, like play heavy games or games that only exist on Windows, I switch within a minute. If you want to try this out, check out the [dualboot tutorial](../dualboot/dualboot.md).

High-level languages are often environment-agnostic and so you won't really need to make a distinction between Linux and Windows for them, but that will come much later.

Editor - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Hands down the most versatile, with a huge community behind it, and Microsoft funding. There's others, obviously, also some that are suited specifically for a language, but until you are mature enough to use them by yourself and be able to tell the difference, stick to vscode.

Browser - eh, doesn't really matter when it comes down to it. Firefox developer tools kind of look cool but it's an overall slow browser. Other than that everything is based on chromium so they all behave the same. Sometimes I like actually using both Firefox and Chrome just for the sake of it, and find that they do some things differently. For website design this is kind of important as ideally you'd like it to look the same on all devices and in all browsers. But that comes later. For now, not to worry about this.
